          The platform is named after the first known translators of a book of
          Brazilian literature into English. Sir Richard Francis Burton
          (1821-1890), and his wife Isabel Burton (1831-1896) are considered the
          pioneers in translating Brazilian literature into English. They had
          contact with author José de Alencar and his literary works while Sir
          Burton served as British consul in Santos, Brazil (1865-1868). The
          English translation for{" "}

          (1886), by José de Alencar, was first published by Bickers and Son
          publishing house, in London. After this first step, hundreds of books
          of literature have been translated into English with the efforts of
          independent translators, literary agents, publishing houses, and
          universities, making Brazilian literature available to the Anglophone
          readership.
